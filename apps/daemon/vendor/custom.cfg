# File:         example.config
#
# Description:  Example user configuration file for Image::ExifTool
#
# Notes:        This example file shows how to define your own shortcuts and
#               add new EXIF, IPTC, XMP, PNG, MIE and Composite tags, as well
#               as how to specify preferred lenses for the LensID tag, and
#               define new file types and default ExifTool option values.
#
#               Note that unknown tags may be extracted even if they aren't
#               defined, but tags must be defined to be written.  Also note
#               that it is possible to override an existing tag definition
#               with a user-defined tag.
#
#               To activate this file, rename it to ".ExifTool_config" and
#               place it in your home directory or the exiftool application
#               directory.  (On Mac and some Windows systems this must be done
#               via the command line since the GUI's may not allow filenames to
#               begin with a dot.  Use the "rename" command in Windows or "mv"
#               on the Mac.)  This causes ExifTool to automatically load the
#               file when run.  Your home directory is determined by the first
#               defined of the following environment variables:
#
#                   1.  EXIFTOOL_HOME
#                   2.  HOME
#                   3.  HOMEDRIVE + HOMEPATH
#                   4.  (the current directory)
#
#               Alternatively, the -config option of the exiftool application
#               may be used to load a specific configuration file (note that
#               this must be the first option on the command line):
#
#                   exiftool -config example.config ...
#
#               For detailed information on the definition of tag tables and
#               tag information hashes, see lib/Image/ExifTool/README.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# NOTE: All tag names used in the following tables are case sensitive.

# The %Image::ExifTool::UserDefined hash defines new tags to be added
# to existing tables.
%Image::ExifTool::UserDefined = (
    # XMP tags may be added to existing namespaces:
    'Image::ExifTool::XMP::xmp' => {
        GoogleMediaItemId => { Writable => 'string' },
    },
);
