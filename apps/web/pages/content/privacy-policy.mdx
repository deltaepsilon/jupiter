# Policies

## Privacy Policy

We store your login user profile, including email and name. 

We don't see or store any passwords because we use Firebase Authentication. If you think you had a password breach, it's probably not us.

We store Google Photos records for any libraries that you import. You can delete Google Photos libraries from your account at any time.

Email chris@chrisesplin.com for a full account deletion.

## Terms of Use

Please don't use our products for anything illegal in the United States of America.

We follow laws from the USA. That's where we live and operate. The USA is a relatively free place. You're in big, big trouble if your photos are illegal in the USA.

We don't look at your data as a rule, but we'll comply with any subpoenas. Frankly, if you're doing something illegal on Google Photos... tough luck. The damage is done. Google will get the supoenaed before we will.

Also, we don't store any actual photos. We only store metadata. If you're doing something illegal with your photo **metadata**... first off, we're baffled at how that's possible, and second, we are not friends and we will narc on you immediately.


## Refund Policy

We would rather refund your money quickly than have an unsatisfied customer. We'd love the chance to solve your problem, and we won't hesitate to issue you a refund if you request it.

Email chris@chrisesplin.com if you're having any issues at all.

## Data Deletion

Email chris@chrisesplin.com for data deletion. We will happily delete your account and all associated data.
