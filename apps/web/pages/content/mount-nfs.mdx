# Mount NFS

**NFS is compatible across Windows, MacOS and Linux.**

NFS stands for **Network File System**.

Microsoft has a [handy overview of NFS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/nfs/nfs-overview) that will teach you the basics.

## Enable NFS on your NAS

Check out our [Synology NFS guide](/content/enable-synology-nfs) for instructions on how to enable NFS on your Synology NAS.

## Linux

In Ubuntu, run a command like the following:

```
mkdir -p /home/synology/homes
mount -t nfs 192.168.86.50:/volume1/homes /home/synology/homes
```

#### Troubleshooting

1. Make sure that the folder you're trying to mount already exists. That's what `mkdir -p /home/synology/homes` does. It makes a directory (`mkdir`) at `/home/synology/homes`. The `-p` flag creates any parent directories that don't already exist.
2. Make sure that you're mounting the right volume path. Synology likes `/volume1/homes`. If you're on a different system, experiment with different paths. Also make sure that your NFS share allows read/write access to your client. Permissions can be tricky to debug and require some persistence.

## MacOS

- Connect to a server
- Add the nfs server with a path like `nfs://192.168.86.50/volume1/homes`
