# Synology NFS Mount

Quiver Photos can mount over NFS to a Synology NAS.

## Synology Guides

1. Follow **[Synology NFS Guide](https://kb.synology.com/en-br/DSM/tutorial/How_to_access_files_on_Synology_NAS_within_the_local_network_NFS)**.

2. Next, read the  **[Synology NFS Permissions Guide](https://kb.synology.com/en-br/DSM/help/DSM/AdminCenter/file_share_privilege_nfs?version=7)**.

It'll look something like this.

![Synology Edit NFS](/images/content/mount-synology-nfs/synology-edit-nfs.png)

3. In Ubuntu, run a command like the following:

```
mkdir /home/synology/homes
mount -t nfs 192.168.86.50:/volume1/homes /home/synology/homes
```

- `/home/synology/homes` is a local directory that we'd like to mount to. We have to create it with `mkdir` if it doesn't exist.
- `192.168.86.50` is the local IP address for our NAS.
- `/volume1/homes` is the path to the directory we want to mount.

## Check the logs

Debug with the logs available at `/var/log/messages`.

We first need to SSH into the NAS.

`ssh quiver@192.168.86.50 -p 22`

Next, tail out the logs.

`sudo tail -f /var/log/messages`
