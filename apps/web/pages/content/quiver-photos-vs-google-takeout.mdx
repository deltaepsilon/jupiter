# Google Takeout

Our [Google Takeout Guide](/content/google-takeout-guide) will walk you through the step-by-step process.

1. Start a Google Takeout export.
2. Wait for Google to prepare your export.
3. Download your export files.
4. Download [Google Photos Takeout Helper by The Last Gimbus](/content/google-takeout-guide#google-photos-takeout-helper-by-the-last-gimbus)
5. Run Google Photos Takeout Helper.

### Pros

- Free
- [Google Photos Takeout Helper by The Last Gimbus](/content/google-takeout-guide#google-photos-takeout-helper-by-the-last-gimbus) is free and open-source.
- Preserves HEIC motion photos.
- Preserves GPS EXIF data.

### Cons

- Each export file is 50gb, and can take hours to download. We had to babysit our downloads over the course of a few days.
- The export files contain duplicate data. They're many times larger than your actual photo library.
- The export files are often incomplete. In our testing, we lost date EXIF data on 20% of our library.
